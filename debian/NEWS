bpfcc (0.2.0-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  Starting with version 0.2.0-2, all binary files have been renamed to
  $filename-bpfcc suffix.
  .
  For example: execsnoop => execsnoop-bpfcc
  .
  Similarly, the manpages have been renamed. This is done to accommodate
  users who would like to use perf-tools-unstable, parallelly with the
  eBPF Compiler Collection Tools from the bpfcc package.
  .
  Both upstreams work closely on the projects, thus the common names.
